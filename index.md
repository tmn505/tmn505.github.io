## AUR packages repository

These are the packages that I maintain on AUR plus their dpendencies
not present in official Arch Linux repositories. All are built with
GitHub Actions. To use the repository, add this to pacman.conf:

```shell
[AUR]
SigLevel = Never TrustAll
Server = https://tmn505.github.io/$repo/$arch
```
